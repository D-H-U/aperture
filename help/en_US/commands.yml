            This command loads all chunks in render distance. It might take a while

                {r}{o}Aperture server command{r}. This command can be used to make given player (by an entity selector) start playing camera profile.
                
                {l}{6}/{r}aperture {8}play{r} {7}<target|camera_profile> [camera_profile]{r}
                
                {r}If you pass only {7}<target|camera_profile>{r}, then the given camera profile will be played back on you. If you pass two arguments after {8}play{r}, then you would be able to specify both player (using username or target selector) and camera profile. 
    
    # Camera's commands
    camera:
        help: "{r}{o}Camera command{r}. Provides sub-commands for managing camera profile and its camera fixtures."
        
        start: 
            |
                {l}{6}/{r}camera {8}start{r} {7}[tick]{r}
                
                {r}Starts a camera profile. Optionally starting from given {7}[tick]{r}.
        stop: 
            |
                {l}{6}/{r}camera {8}stop{r}
        
                {r}Stops currently running camera profile

        default:
            |
                {l}{6}/{r}camera {8}default{r}
                
                {r}Resets camera's {7}Field-Of-View{r} and {7}roll{r} to default values ({7}70.0{r} and {7}0.0{r} degrees).
        fov: 
            |
                {l}{6}/{r}camera {8}fov{r} {7}[fov]{r}
                
                Set or get client's camera {l}Field Of View{r} ({8}fov{r}) setting.
        roll: 
            |
                {l}{6}/{r}camera {8}roll{r} {7}[roll]{r}
                
                {r}Set or get client's camera {7}[roll]{r} (rotation across {7}Z-axis{r}).
        
        rotate:
            |
                {l}{6}/{r}camera {8}rotate{r} {7}[yaw] [pitch]{r}
                
                {r}Set camera's angle based on absolute or relative values. You can set absolute angle of the camera by specifying plain floating point numbers {6}/camera {8}rotate {7}90 90{r}. Or you can provide a relative value by using {7}~+{r} or {7}~-{r} signs {6}/camera {8}rotate {7}~0.5 ~-0.5{r}.
        
        step:
            |
                {l}{6}/{r}camera {8}step{r} {7}[x] [y] [z]{r}
                
                {r}Set camera's position based on absolute or relative values. You can set absolute position of the camera by specifying plain floating point numbers {6}/camera {8}step {7}0 4 0{r}. Or you can provide a relative value by using {7}~+{r} or {7}~-{r} signs {6}/camera {8}step {7}~0 ~0.1 ~0{r}. It works similar to {6}/tp{r} command.

        reload:
            |
                {l}{6}/{r}camera {8}reload{r}

                {r}Reload camera editor.
